              %p Biodiversity is the issue that ties the rest of the environmental issues listed here together. It is, broadly defined, the huge and almost incomprehensible variety of different species that inhabit the world. Biodiversity is being threatened, though, by human activity&mdash;from habitat loss, from climate change, and from introduction of invasive species. And when we lose genetic diversity in the world, we're not only losing species that don't affect us&mdash;we're losing valuable natural resources that sustain us, as well, including food sources, origins for medical drugs, and bases for jobs and livelihoods.

                Climate change is a global problem, but it is already starting to have tangible and direct effects on the Pioneer Valley. Among the projected effects of climate change are more frequent severe weather events, three of which occurred in 2011 alone: a series of tornados in the Springfield area on June 1

                , flooding from Tropical Storm Irene on August 28-29

                \.&nbsp;A record-breaking heat wave also swept across the entire United States in July 2012.
              %p In addition to an average temperature increase of 3-5 degrees F by 2050 at current greenhouse gas emission levels, it is expected that by the end of the century there will be anywhere from 30 to 60 days of extreme heat (over 90 degrees) in comparison with the 5 to 20 at current levels. Precipitation levels will also fluctuate much more extremely&mdash;while there are expected to be instances of extreme flooding once every 2-3 years, and a general increase in precipitation during winter months, Massachusetts will also have a 75% increase in drought events which will last from 1-3 months.
              %p All of these changes raise significant risks to other environmental factors. Temperature increases alone may force wildlife to migrate to the cooler places that they are better suited to survive, but increased flooding events may destroy habitats entirely. Flooding is particularly dangerous due to sewage disposal infrastructure's demonstrated vulnerabilities; during Tropical Storm Irene, raw sewage was discharged to the Connecticut River for several days when flood waters knocked the Greenfield wastewater facility offline.

              %p Invasive species represent a significant threat to local wildlife, displacing and leading to habitat loss for native flora and fauna. In extreme cases, they can even change characteristics of the ecosystem itself. Native species are usually introduced unintentionally by human activity, managing to survive in transit from their original native environment. After they establish themselves in the new environment, there is often a lag period before they begin to reproduce and spread more rapidly.
              %p There are a wide variety of invasive species which have had an impact on the Pioneer Valley.  One of the most notorious among them, the gypsy moth, was introduced to Massachusetts in the 1860s, and since then has spread through the northeastern United States.  Gypsy moth caterpillars defoliate oaks and other hardwood trees, causing extensive damage or even killing their host trees.

                Habitat loss is a major threat to biodiversity both in the Pioneer Valley and the wider world. Human activity is usually the cause of habitat loss, either directly through agriculture, land and water development, or indirectly through climate change

                The Connecticut River flows through the Pioneer Valley, and is home to a variety of aquatic species. However, human infrastructure in the form of dams and culverts has changed the natural flow regime and chemistry of the river, which has concerning implications for its ecology. There are 1,422 dams in MA and CT alone, which averages 1 dam per 6.6 km of river, in addition to 2,885 culverts in the Valley. The alterations to the river's flow regime restrict access to quality habitat for one or more life stages of various species, such as the ability for
                %span{:title => "fish which spend most of their life in seawater, but lay their eggs in freshwater"}> anadromous fish
                to reach preferred freshwater spawning habitats from the sea, as well as blocking access to thermal refuges for brook trout populations. In addition, pollution and wastewater runoff from flooding and stormwaters in urban areas also contribute to making the Connecticut River unsuitable for habitation.
              %p
                Urban sprawl represents another threat to habitat loss, as natural environments are replaced with man-made buildings and roads. Neighborhood Nestwatch seeks to learn more about how habitat loss in the form of increasing urban sprawl impacts bird nesting habits. To learn more, click

Assisted by scientists, participants learn how to locate nests in their backyards and count the eggs or recently-hatched birds within. In addition, the experts apply bands to adult birds so that the citizen scientists can track the birds' year-to-year returns to their nesting sites.
